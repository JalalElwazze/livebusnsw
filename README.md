# livebuses

This is a web application to monitor and track NSW buses. 
This is primarily a test to get used to using mapping tools for datasets as well as calling APIs. 
It is quite sensitive to the type of browswer you use and not all features are currently active. 

Starting the app: 
- Click the link: https://livebusnsw.herokuapp.com (heroku is a free server, this may take a few minutes) 
- If the map does not appear immediately please refresh your browswer (this may need to be repeated multiple times) 

Using the app: 
- At the top left you have the live updating map of all NSW buses coloured by their occupancy. Hover over them
for more details 
- On the right is a placeholder, this will be replcaed by the trip planner (see trip_plan_test.py)
- at the bottom is a chart that displays the facilities available at various stations, the dropdown is searchable
